* Mix 640ml of warm water + 30g fresh yeast + 1kg high-gluten flour + 2 teaspoons of salt + 3 tablespoon of olive oil
* Knead for 5min
* Cover and let rise for 2h at 35C (95F)
* Split in 8 balls, cover and let rise for 72h at 6C (43F). The balls will more than double in volume, 
  so give them enough room so that they do not fuse with each other.
